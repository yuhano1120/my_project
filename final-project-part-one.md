# Outline
 
For my final project, I plan to analyze crime incident data from Pennsylvania to uncover patterns across time, location, and offense type. This dataset provides detailed attributes such as report numbers, dates and times, geographic coordinates, offense categories, and neighborhoods. By visualizing these attributes, I want to highlight when crimes are most likely to occur, where they concentrate, and what types of offenses dominate in different contexts.

The goal of this project is not only to show descriptive trends but also to tell a compelling story about public safety. Crime impacts communities differently across neighborhoods, time periods, and categories. By creating a structured narrative, I want to move from a “big picture” overview into more focused insights—identifying hotspots, risky time windows, and offense categories that stand out. These insights could ultimately support better resource allocation, community awareness, and policy discussions.

1.Overall trends
To show the trend of #incidends in PA in months(2024.1-2025.8). Maybe I will consider using moving average to smooth the curve. 

2. When do crimes happen
I plan to use two pie charts to show the percentage of crime in night vs. day and weekdays vs. weekend.

3.Where do crimes happen
To begin with, I will try to show the intensity(density) of the crimes in map using XCOORD and YCOORD. I assume that this map will be difficult to compelete but I will try first, and then decide whether I want to keep it in my project. In addition, I want to use a ranking bar plot to show the top 10 neighborhood with most crime incidents.

4. What type of crimes happen
I want to show what kinds of crime happen most. Pie chart or stacked bar plot can help to show the percentage of NIBRS_Offense_Category or Crime_Against (Person, Property, Society).

5. Interaction



## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

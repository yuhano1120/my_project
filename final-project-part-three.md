# The final data story
[Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/K31qOA9hxgt8khpl)

My final data story, “Crime in Pittsburgh: What New Students Should Know,” presents Pittsburgh’s crime data from 2024 to 2025 through a narrative designed to be clear, relevant, and useful for new students.
Instead of showing every detail of the dataset, I focused on three key perspectives—When, Where, and How—to guide the audience step by step from understanding the data to taking action.

The story begins with an introduction that acknowledges the excitement and challenges of moving to a new city. It then transitions into visual insights:
	•	A line chart showing the monthly trend, highlighting that crimes peak in summer, especially in July.
	•	A bar chart for crime by hour, showing that incidents often occur around 4–5 PM, not just at night.
	•	A tree map displaying neighborhood hotspots, emphasizing that busier areas see more incidents.
	•	A pie chart summarizing that most crimes are property-related, reinforcing the importance of everyday precautions.

Each section ends with practical takeaways to help new students stay safe—like staying alert in summer afternoons, being cautious in crowded neighborhoods, and locking bikes or bags.
Finally, the story closes with key safety reminders and introduces CMU Alert and the Rave Guardian app as actionable resources for real-life use.

Through these elements, my final story balances data accuracy with personal relevance. It aims not just to inform, but to empower students to feel more confident and prepared as they begin their life in Pittsburgh.

# Changes made since Part II
Since Part II, I shifted my focus from simply explaining crime data to telling a story that is meaningful and useful for new students.
Originally, my project title was “Analyzing Crime Patterns in Pittsburgh (2024–2025)”, which mainly focused on describing data trends. After receiving feedback, I reframed it as “Crime in Pittsburgh: What New Students Should Know” to make it more relevant, story-driven, and actionable.

To strengthen the narrative, I reorganized the structure around three key questions—When to be alert, Where to be cautious, and How to protect yourself.
At the end of each section, I added specific, practical advice directly tied to the data.
For example, after showing that crime peaks in summer afternoons, I reminded students to stay alert during outdoor activities; when presenting neighborhood patterns, I suggested paying attention to routes and surroundings in busier areas; and when explaining crime types, I encouraged small daily habits like locking bikes and securing bags.

In the conclusion, I summarized the key takeaways and introduced two useful safety tools—CMU Alert and the Rave Guardian app—to give the audience clear next steps.
These additions helped transform my project from a static data dashboard into a cohesive story that connects insights with real-world actions for students moving to Pittsburgh.

## The audience
The main audience for my final data story is new students at Carnegie Mellon University and other universities in Pittsburgh who are just beginning to explore the city. Many of them are unfamiliar with local neighborhoods and may not know when or where to be more cautious.

From my early feedback and informal conversations with classmates, I found that new students often worry about personal safety, transportation routes, and where it’s safe to hang out or live. This insight helped me narrow the focus of my story—not just to show crime data, but to translate it into practical guidance that directly answers these concerns.

To fit this audience, I avoided technical or statistical language and used a friendly, conversational tone. I also kept the visuals simple and intuitive, using clear charts and warm color tones that made the story feel approachable.
Each section was designed to address a real question students might have—When should I be alert? Where should I be cautious? How can I protect myself?—so the data connects naturally to their daily experiences.

By the end, I wanted the story to feel less like a formal report and more like a friendly safety orientation—something that new students could actually use as they start discovering Pittsburgh.

## Final design decisions
Throughout the design process, my main goal was to make the data story clear, focused, and meaningful for new students—not just visually appealing. I realized early on that too many charts or complex visuals could overwhelm the audience, so I made several key design decisions to simplify and strengthen the narrative.

First, I decided to use only four essential visualizations:
	•	A line chart for overall monthly trends,
	•	A bar chart for crime by hour,
	•	A tree map to highlight neighborhood hotspots, and
	•	A pie chart to show the breakdown of crime types.
This limited selection kept the story concise while still showing different dimensions of the data.

In terms of structure, I followed a clear and logical “When – Where – How” framework. This not only made the story easier to follow but also reinforced a sense of progression—from understanding patterns to taking action. Each section ends with a short, practical suggestion, so the reader feels guided rather than just informed.

Finally, I focused on balance between data and empathy—keeping enough factual content to stay credible while using conversational language to keep it approachable. Through this process, I learned that effective data storytelling is not about showing everything you found—it’s about showing what matters most to your audience in a way they can remember and use.

## AI acknowledgements
I used ChatGPT (GPT-5) mainly to help me refine and shorten my presentation script.
My original draft was about two to three minutes long, and through AI-assisted editing, I was able to condense it to a clear and engaging one-minute version without losing key content.

The AI also helped me adjust transitions between sections and make the tone more concise and story-driven, ensuring the narrative flowed naturally for my target audience.
All data analysis, visualizations, and design decisions were completed independently by me. The AI’s role was limited to language refinement and time-focused editing, in full accordance with the course guidelines.

# Final thoughts
Working on this project taught me how to move beyond simply showing data and instead create a story that connects to people’s real experiences. At first, I focused mostly on analysis and visualization, but over time I realized that the real impact comes from meaning and context—helping my audience understand why the data matters to them.

If I had more time, I would like to make the story interactive, allowing users to filter by neighborhood or time of day to explore patterns that are most relevant to them. I would also refine the design to include more personal perspectives, such as quotes or short experiences from students about safety in Pittsburgh.

In addition, I would expand the project by combining other datasets—such as housing prices, supermarket and restaurant density, and transportation convenience—to give new students a more holistic view of living in Pittsburgh. This could turn the story into a broader city guide that not only highlights safety but also helps students choose where to live, shop, and explore.

Overall, I’m proud that my final story turned into something practical and relatable. It not only presents insights but also offers real actions students can take—helping them feel more confident and prepared as they start their life in Pittsburgh.

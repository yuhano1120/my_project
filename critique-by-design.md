# Title
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

I chose this visualization because it allows the audience to quickly and easily compare public holidays across countries. The map format is intuitive, and the interactive features let users access detailed information without sifting through raw data. It effectively communicates differences at a glance.

## Step two: the critique
Strengths:

Appropriate visualization type: Using a map allows viewers to quickly understand the geographic distribution of public holidays.

Effective use of color intensity: Darker shades immediately draw attention to countries with more holidays (e.g., India), highlighting key differences at a glance.

Interactive feature: Hovering over a country displays its name and exact number of holidays, providing detailed information without cluttering the map.

Areas for improvement:

Legend design: The current legend uses discrete increments of 5 (5, 10, â€¦, 40, 45), but many countries do not fall exactly on these multiples. This can be misleading.

Tooltip: Adding more information of the holidays and the rank.

Summary:
The visualization communicates the main message effectively and engages the audience through interactivity, but adjusting the legend would make the data representation even clearer and more precise.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._

# Critique-By-Design


## Step one: the visualization

I chose this visualization because it allows the audience to quickly and easily compare public holidays across countries. The map format is intuitive, and the interactive features let users access detailed information without sifting through raw data. It effectively communicates differences at a glance.

## Step two: the critique

Strengths:
1. Appropriate visualization type: Using a map allows viewers to quickly understand the geographic distribution of public holidays.
2. Effective use of color intensity: Darker shades immediately draw attention to countries with more holidays (e.g., India), highlighting key differences at a glance.
3. Interactive feature: Hovering over a country displays its name and exact number of holidays, providing detailed information without cluttering the map.

Areas for improvement:
1. Legend design: The current legend uses discrete increments of 5 (5, 10, …, 40, 45), but many countries do not fall exactly on these multiples. This can be misleading.
2. Tooltip: Adding more information of the holidays and the rank.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

To address the issue with the legend, I would redesign the visualization by replacing the discrete legend with a continuous color gradient. This would ensure that every country’s number of public holidays is represented more precisely, and the audience would have an easier time interpreting subtle differences across countries.

This would ensure that every country’s number of public holidays is represented more precisely, and the audience would have an easier time interpreting subtle differences across countries.

In addition, I would enrich the tooltip content. Besides showing the country name and total number of holidays, the tooltip would also include short explanatory notes or contextual details. For example: Germany — Varies from 10–13 depending on the state. This additional information would make the visualization not only more accurate, but also more informative for audiences interested in cultural or policy differences.

Overall, the revised design would maintain the strengths of the original (geographic clarity and interactivity) while improving both the accuracy of the legend and the depth of contextual insights available to users.




## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
